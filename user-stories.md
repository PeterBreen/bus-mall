#User Stories for BusMall  
*March 28, 2016*  

BusMall has three major user types during our exciting, paradigm-shifting, direct-to-customer bus marketing marketing disruption high-intensity startup phase. 95 hour workweek minimums, but there's a free pinball machine you'll never use!  

  - Business Owner, who has a lot of VC angel investors on their case to turn a profit so they can sell high and make a nice quarterly profit while probably ruining the company's long-term future  
  - Marketing Team, who are running out of excuses to give to management as to why they haven't produced a BIG WIN for a sixteen billion IPO like Facebook  
  - Focus Tester/Bus Rider, who wants that free Amazon giftcard they were promised for looking at weird product photos, and if they're lucky, an escape from the hell that is rush-hour I-5 commuting.

These are their stories.
